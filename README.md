# React + Vite

# React Users Table

This is a small React project where I display users in a table.  
The data is coming from a JSON file and I added some basic functionality on top of it.

### What it can do
- search by first name or last name  
- sort columns (first name, last name, age, website, email)  
- pagination with previous / next buttons  
- click a userâ€™s name to see a detail page  

### Tech used
React with hooks, React Router for navigation, simple fetch for data, and I separated sorting logic into a `utils` folder to keep it clean.  

### Run locally
Clone this repo, install dependencies, and start:

```bash
git clone ...........................................
cd .............................
npm install
npm start
